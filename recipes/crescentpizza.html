    <p>Make perfect pizza pockets by wrapping pizza sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni in crescent dough and baking until golden
    brown. This recipe is very entertaining and the result is great.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls</li>
        <li>¼ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll dough on cookie sheet and separate into 4 rectangles; press each into 6x4-inch
        rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon pizza sauce on half of each rectangle to within 1 inch of edge. Sprinkle each with 3 tablespoons
        cheese; top with 6 slices pepperoni. Fold dough diagonally over filling; firmly press edges with fork to seal. Sprinkle
        each triangle with 1/4 teaspoon grated cheese. With fork, prick top of each to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake 13 to 15 minutes or until deep golden brown. Serve warm.</li>
